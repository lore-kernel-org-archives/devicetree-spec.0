To start with I'm constraining what is permissible in the YAML
encoding. So, even though YAML can encode multiple nested lists, I'm
not permitting that in this iteration. To take an example:

in dts: reg = <0x1000 0x100> <0x4000 0x300>;
In YAML I'm encoding as:   reg: [ [0x1000, 0x100], [0x4000, 0x300] ]

in dts: compatible = "acme,uart9000", "ns16550"
is in YAML: compatible: [ "acme,uart9000", "ns16550"]

in dts: #size-cells = <1>;
in YAML: "#size-cells": [ [ 1 ] ]

in dts: uint16-prop = /bits/ 16 <31>;
in YAML: uint16-prop: [ !uint16 [31] ]

I'm not allowing anything outside that pattern. So, the following are
all disallowed currently:
reg: [0x1000, 0x100, 0x4000, 0x300] /* integers need to be in a list -
maps to <...> in dts */
compatible: "ns16550" /* not encoded into list */
reg: [ [ [0x4, 0xffff0000], 0x80000], [ [0x4, 0xfffe0000], 0x40000] ]
/* Triple nesting not allowed*/

This could be relaxed later to allow arbitrary YAML structure and
encoding rules to go with them. The markers could even be nested to
keep track of the nesting in DTC, but I want to take the cautious
route and simply disallow that for now.

<digress>
You'll notice that I'm always encoding a property as a list. That's to
be able to preserve the grouping that is usually in .dts files, but
avoid ambiguity between when something is a single value or a tuple.
So, even though "#size-cells":1 would make the most sense, DTC has no
good way to know when a property is a single value, a list of single
values, or a list of tuples.

For example: given in dts interrupts = <10>; how should DTC encode it
into YAML without knowing the binding? Is it:

interrupts:10
interrupts: [ 10 ]
interrupts: [ [ 10 ] ]

In this case the best choice would be [ [ 10 ] ] because each
interrupt specifier is a tuple, and interrupts is a list of interrupt
specifiers. Being really strict about this makes it simpler to craft
schema tests because the schema doesn't need to account for multiple
encodings.

I am thinking about another way to skin this though. If the binding
schemas are available to DTC at YAML emit time, then I can force the
correct encoding. So, if DTC knows it is a #size-cells property, then
it know that is must be encoded as a bare integer.
