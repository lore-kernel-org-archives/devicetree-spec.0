Hum, this means a new tags.

local references: ok, phandle to to local node.

external references: phandle to external node.
This has to be resolved based on exports available in the device-tree the
addon is applied to.

Here, the node is not external. It is available in the addon and so it is
a local node.

No import/export mechanism is needed to resolve the phandle. Indeed, this
phandle is already well defined (resolved) in the addon blob.

Having a kind of 'local' import/export to allow local cross-tree references
is going to add an extra complexity where it is not needed.

Look at the related test (patch 65).

In the tests/metadata_addon_references.dts, you can find:
--- 8< ---
&base1 {
	b1_addon: addon-node {
		prop = <2>;
	};
};

&base2 {
	addon-node1 {
		ref-base1-addon-node = <&b1_addon>;
	};
	...
};
--- 8< ---

Converted to dtb and analyzed by fdtdump, this leads to
(tests/metadata_addon_references.dtb.expect):
--- 8< ---
&base1 {
    addon-node {
        prop = <0x00000002>;
        phandle = <0x00000001>;
    };
};
&base2 {
    addon-node1 {
        ref-base1-addon-node = <0x00000001>;
        // [FDT_REF_LOCAL] ref-base1-addon-node[0]
    };
    ...
};
--- 8< ---

This dtb, as all dtbs, can be converted back to a dts.

Having a syntax to reference orphan node by path allows to use this
syntax in the 'ref-base1-addon-node' property. You can find it in
tests/metadata_addon_references.dtb.dts.expect
--- 8< ---
&base1 {

	addon-node {
		prop = <0x02>;
		phandle = <0x01>;
	};
};

&base2 {

	addon-node1 {
		ref-base1-addon-node = <&{$base1/addon-node}>;
	};
	...
};
--- 8< ---

We could only use the phandle value:
   ref-base1-addon-node = <0x01>;

Which is perfectly legit and fully matches what is encoded in the dtb.

But I think it was very interesting, thanks to meta-data, to identify that
this is a phandle and so use a reference instead of a integer (phandle).

No label are stored in the dtb and there is no need to store them. Further
more, a node, in a dts can have several label. Which one to store? The
first one, all, ...

Using export, lead to the node visible to any addon applied. That's not the
expectation.

Using import, means the symbol is external. That's not the case.

A local node exists in the dtb. We should be able to reference it by path.

/ {
    foo {
	bar {
	    ...
	};
    }
};

With the root tree, the 'bar' node, can be referenced by /foo/bar.

Now, with orphan:
&orphan {
    foo {
        bar {
	    ....
        };
    };
};

How to reference 'bar' by path?

We need to identify 'orphan' instead of root ('/') $orphan/foo/bar is the
syntax I propose to do that. Of course, this syntax can be discussed.

IMHO, I thing the feature consisting in referencing by path a node in an
orphan tree is needed and avoid extra complexity.

Hervé
